I am going through the following issue
/* cloning the bitcoin source in my system so as to install from source */
The Error I am getting here is described as follows :

  vagrant@ubuntu-xenial:~/HelloEther$ sudo git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
  Cloning into 'bitcoin'...
  fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git/': server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none

/*
Really messing everything up
*/

/*
But still not working
*/

A possible woraound that I just test I to 
/*----------------------------------------*/
export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
#or
git config --global http.sslverify false
/*-----------------------------------------*/
